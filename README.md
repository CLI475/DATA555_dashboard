# P300 BCI Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes simulated EEG signals and prediction accuracy trends using Bayesian modeling techniques for P300-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). It is designed to support exploratory data analysis of ERP patterns and model performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of simulated EEG signals and prediction accuracy data generated based on real-world patterns from the University of Michigan Direct Brain Interface (UM-DBI) project. It includes 3,420 observations with 50 features each, representing two EEG channels after preprocessing. The data replicates typical P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) and is used to evaluate Bayesian sequential updating models for ERP detection.

## Real-World Impact
This dashboard supports the development of adaptive P300-based BCI systems by highlighting ERP signal patterns and model accuracy trends. It aims to enhance communication tools for individuals with severe motor impairments through improved signal interpretation and classification accuracy.

## How to View the Dashboard
